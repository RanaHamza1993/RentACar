    <!--Terms of use-->
    <!--Obligatory documents for your pick-up-->
    <string name="obligatory">With no exceptions, you must have these documents with you when arriving at your car hire agency to pick up your car:
        \n&#8226; ID card

       \n&#8226;  Credit card
    </string>
    <!--Young and senior driver fee-->
    <string name="young_and_senior">No matter how skilled, if you are a very young or older driver, rental agencies may see you as a possible liability to their fleet. That’s why you can expect a daily young driver’s fee if you’re younger than 25. To avoid extra charges at the counter, please be sure that you enter your exact age during your booking process.</string>
    <!--Additional driver fee-->
    <string name="driver_fee">If there is a chance, usually there are two or more people that drive a hired car. However, remember that for every additional driver you have to pay additional driver fee. (First additional driver is sometimes included, but rarely. Check supplier’s terms for specific instructions.) Also, all drivers must present essential documents at the pick-up.</string>
    <!--Fuel policies and surcharges-->
    <string name="fuel_policies">With most fuel policies, you’ll have to fill your tank before you return your car to the car hire agency.
